# cpp-linked-list-
A project related to linked lists
<h1><b>Linked list</b></h1>
 <p>Here in this project I am trying to display the use of doubly linked list in Cpp, by using a president, secretary, and a few members as an example. I have used <u>President</u> as the head node, <u>Secretary</u> as the tail node and the <u>Members</u> as all the nodes in between</p>
<p>I have also concatenated the nodes defined inside the function 
 <br>void pinnacle::concate(pinnacle p,pinnacle p1)</br>
 <br>Where p and p1 are the objects created respectively</p></br>
<p>And reversed the node defined inside
 <br>void pinnacle::reverse(node *p)</br></p>
<p>One can also search for a node or also display the nodes respectively</p>
